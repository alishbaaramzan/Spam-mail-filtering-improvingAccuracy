# Spam-mail-filtering

A text classifier in Python using classification algorithms of machine learning (Support vector machines, Naïve Bayes classifier, Random Forest) to detect if a given mail or message is spam or ham (not spam). Spam dataset was derived from Kaggle, UCI repository etc.

E-mail is an effective and very cheap means of communication, this fact is being exploited by numerous organizations for carrying out their advertisements. This process is being carried out so extensively that, email inboxes of millions of people are filled with spam e-mails. This results in a lot of wastage of valuable time for each user, to go through the spam emails. Additionally, spam emails traffic between servers results in a delay in the delivery of important e-mails at the right time to the users. Considering the scale and intensity of this problem, we developed a system that uses the concepts of Multinomial Naïve Bayes theorem, Supports Vector Machines, and Random Forest to identify spam e-mails. Our spam detection system identifies emails that are spam emails and in turn saves time for millions of users.

The Random Forest classifier enhances the accuracy and robustness of the model by aggregating predictions from multiple decision trees. It reduces overfitting compared to individual decision trees and provides better generalization to unseen data. This leads to improved performance in identifying spam emails, resulting in more accurate classification and reduced false positives or negatives. As a result, our spam detection system becomes more reliable and effective in saving users' time and resources.
